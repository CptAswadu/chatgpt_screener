1,Increased coronary vessel wall thickness in HIV-infected young adults,"Background. Individuals with long-term human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at risk for premature vasculopathy and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We evaluated coronary vessel wall thickening, coronary plaque, and epicardial fat in patients infected with HIV early in life compared with healthy controls. Methods. This is a prospective cross-sectional study of 35 young adults who acquired HIV in early life and 11 healthy controls, free of CVD. Time resolved phase-sensitive dual inversion recovery black-blood vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (TRAPD) was used to measure proximal right coronary artery (RCA) wall thickness, and multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography was used to quantify coronary plaque and epicardial fat. Results. RCA vessel wall thickness was significantly increased in HIV-infected patients compared with sex- and race-matched controls (1.32 ± 0.21 mm vs 1.09 ± 0.14 mm, P =.002). No subject had discrete plaque on CT sufficient to cause luminal narrowing, and plaque was not related to RCA wall thickness. In multivariate regression analyses, smoking pack-years (P =.004) and HIV infection (P =.007) were independently associated with thicker RCA vessel walls. Epicardial fat did not differ between groups. Among the HIV-infected group, duration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (P =.02), duration of stavudine exposure (P <.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P =.04), and smoking pack-years (P <.01) were positively correlated with RCA wall thickness. Conclusions. This investigation provides evidence of subclinical coronary vascular disease among individuals infected with HIV in early life. Increased duration of ART, hyperlipidemia, and smoking contributed to proximal RCA thickening, independent of atherosclerotic plaque quantified by CT. These modifiable risk factors appear to influence early atherogenesis as measured by coronary wall thickness and may be important targets for CVD risk reduction.",2014,Journal Article,1,The article is not relevant to the given PICOS as it does not involve patients with vasculitis and does not compare MR vessel wall imaging with other imaging modalities for diagnostic accuracy.
2,High-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging in cerebrovascular diseases,"Most intracranial vascular disorders like atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) share similar lumenographic findings in traditional imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiographic studies. Hence, there is a need for an advanced imaging modality like vessel wall imaging (VWI) to confirm the diagnosis so that appropriate clinical management could be done. Now, currently vessel wall imaging could be done in a high resolution manner with three dimensional (3D) imaging sequences. The aim of this article is to deal with the protocol as well as the current imaging applications of the high resolution VWI.",2018,Journal Article,4,The article is relevant to the PICOS as it discusses the use of MR vessel wall imaging in diagnosing intracranial vascular disorders like vasculitis.

3,Reversible vessel wall enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 'black blood' as a result of possible cocaine induced vasculopathy,"Introduction: MRI 'black blood' imaging (T1-weighted fat and blood suppressed sequences) is an imaging technique increasingly used to differentiate contrast enhancement of intracranial vessel walls seen in an inflammatory vasculitis from other intracranial vasculopathies. Reversibility of vessel wall enhancement in a cocaine induced vasculopathy has been reported. Method: A 27-year-old man presented with right hemisensory loss, leg weakness and inferior quadrantanopia for several days. His history included systemic lupus erythematous, not clinically active, under regular rheumatology review. He was a smoker and admitted to regular use of cocaine, opioids, gabapentin and cannabis. Initial NIHSS was 3. MRI brain confirmed a scattered left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarct. Urgent CT angiogram revealed irregularity and attenuation of the left PCA and right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Results: MRI 'black-blood' imaging revealed non-concentric vessel wall enhancement of the basilar artery along its length and in a number of smaller vessels in the PCA and MCA territories bilaterally. Catheter angiography was not performed. Toxicology was positive for cocaine and cannabinoids. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis, virology, vasculitic work up and CT PET were normal. He remained clinically and radiologically stable. Vessel wall enhancement almost entirely resolved at 6 weeks with abstinence from all illicit substances however multifocal intracranial stenoses on MR angiography persisted. Conclusion: Contrast enhancement of intracranial vessel walls on MRI 'black blood' imaging is generally thought to represent an inflammatory vasculitis. This case highlights reversibility of vessel wall enhancement with persisting arterial narrowing as a result of a possible cocaine induced vasculopathy.",2019,Journal Article,1,"The article is not relevant to the PICOS as it discusses a case of possible cocaine-induced vasculopathy and not vasculitis.

4,High-resolution intracranial vessel wall imaging: imaging beyond the lumen,"Accurate and timely diagnosis of intracranial vasculopathies is important due to significant risk of morbidity with delayed and/or incorrect diagnosis both from the disease process as well as inappropriate therapies. Conventional vascular imaging techniques for analysis of intracranial vascular disease provide limited information since they only identify changes to the vessel lumen. New advanced MR intracranial vessel wall imaging (IVW) techniques can allow direct characterisation of the vessel wall. These techniques can advance diagnostic accuracy and may potentially improve patient outcomes by better guided treatment decisions in comparison to previously available invasive and noninvasive techniques. While neuroradiological expertise is invaluable in accurate examination interpretation, clinician familiarity with the application and findings of the various vasculopathies on IVW can help guide diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. This review article provides a brief overview of the technical aspects of IVW and discusses the IVW findings of various intracranial vasculopathies, differentiating characteristics and indications for when this technique can be beneficial in patient management.",2016,Journal Article,4,"The article is relevant as it discusses the use of MR intracranial vessel wall imaging (IVW) techniques for the diagnosis of intracranial vasculopathies, which is the intervention of interest. It also discusses the potential benefits of IVW in patient management, including improved diagnostic accuracy. However, the article does not specifically compare IVW to other imaging modalities, which is the comparison of interest."
5,INTRA CRA NIAL VESSEL-WALL IMAGING: BEYOND LUMINAL ABNORMALITIES AND INTO THE VASCULAR WALL,"Introduction: Intracranial vessel-wall imaging (iVWI) provides evaluation of pathologic processes specific to the vessel wall, increasing the diagnostic accuracy for an array of vasculopathies, including in ischemic stroke (IS). Objectives and Methods: We reviewed the current literature about iVWI technique and conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing iVWI between 01/01/2017 and 25/05/2022 in our Institution in order to: summarize the typical imagiological patterns and select illustrative cases for each vasculopathy; evaluate the correlation between the final clinical diagnosis and imagiological findings in our sample; assess commonly encountered artifacts and pitfalls; and describe the evolution of our own institutional protocol based upon the published technical requirements for iVWI acquisition. Results: After excluding patients with aneurysms (n=19), our sample size consisted of 60 patients, mean age of 53 ± 13 yearsold, with 46 (77%) having IS. VWI findings were suggestive of atherosclerosis in 20 patients, vasculitis in 11 patients, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome in 3 patients, arterial dissection in 3 patients, and Moyamoya in 2 patients; a clot was detected in 2 cases. The study was unremarkable in 16 cases and inconclusive in 3. Although the clinical workup was not concluded in 10% of the cases, the remaining iVWI findings were clinically confirmed in all but one patient. Accurate iVWI interpretation is critically dependent on adequate imaging technique and on the observer experience. Normal variations (including incomplete signal suppression of blood flow, the presence of vasa vasorum or adjacent veins) may be misinterpreted as pathological when either of these factors is lacking. The small size and tortuous orientations of intracranial arteries pose unique technical challenges, requiring high spatial resolution images with high signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. In our Institution, the experience with iVWI has evolved from preand post-contrast 2D acquisitions to isotropic 3D sequences with intrinsic “black blood” properties (SPACE) and an additional specialized blood suppression technique, mostly acquired using a 3 T scanner. Discussion and Conclusion: Vessel-wall imaging is a useful complement to conventional luminal imaging techniques in the differential diagnosis of vasculopathies, thus helping to unveil the aetiology of cryptogenic stroke and prevent further vascular events. However, technical limitations and the personnel experience required for interpretation may limit more generalized applicability.

6,Non-invasive imaging of vascular inflammation,"In large-vessel vasculitides, inflammatory infiltrates may cause thickening of the involved arterial vessel wall leading to progressive stenosis and occlusion. Dilatation, aneurysm formation, and thrombosis may also ensue. Activated macrophages and T lymphocytes are fundamental elements in vascular inflammation. The amount and density of the inflammatory infiltrate is directly linked to local disease activity. Additionally, patients with autoimmune disorders have an increased cardiovascular (CV) risk compared with agematched healthy individuals as a consequence of accelerated atherosclerosis. Molecular imaging techniques targeting activated macrophages, neovascularization, or increased cellular metabolic activity can represent effective means of non-invasive detection of vascular inflammation. In the present review, novel non-invasive imaging tools that have been successfully tested in humans will be presented. These include contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, which allows detection of neovessels within the wall of inflamed arteries; contrast-enhanced CV magnetic resonance that can detect increased thickness of the arterial wall, usually associated with edema, or mural enhancement using T2 and post-contrast T1-weighted sequences, respectively; and positron emission tomography associated with radio-tracers such as [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose and the new [11C]-PK11195 in combination with computed tomography angiography to detect activated macrophages within the vessel wall. Imaging techniques are useful in the diagnostic work-up of large- and mediumvessel vasculitides, to monitor disease activity and the response to treatments. Finally, molecular imaging targets can provide new clues about the pathogenesis and evolution of immune-mediated disorders involving arterial vessels. © 2014 Ammirati, Moroni, Pedrotti, Scotti, Magnoni, Bozzolo, Rimoldi and Camici.",2014,Journal Article,4,"The article is relevant to the PICOS as it discusses non-invasive imaging techniques, including contrast-enhanced CV magnetic resonance, for detecting vascular inflammation in patients with vasculitis.

7,Arteritis and large vessel occlusive strokes in children after COVID-19 infection,"We describe 2 previously healthy children who suffered disabling arterial ischemic strokes because of acute intracranial large vessel occlusion within 3 to 4 weeks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Both children presented from communities with high COVID-19 case rates in the Southwest United States. An 8-year-old American Indian girl experienced severe iron deficiency anemia requiring blood transfusion and presented with bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution strokes 3 weeks later. She underwent emergent mechanical thrombectomy of the left MCA with successful clot retrieval but experienced reocclusion of that artery 5 hours after intervention. She also had evidence of cerebral arteritis on catheter angiography and vessel wall imaging, and clot pathology revealed recently formed, unorganized platelet- and fibrin-rich thrombus with sparse clusters of erythrocytes, degenerated histiocytes, few eosinophils, and rare neutrophils. A 16-year old African American boy demonstrated evidence of arteritis on brain magnetic resonance angiography and serological markers of cardiac and renal injury accompanied by positive lupus anticoagulant antibodies. The children described in this report express clinical features inconsistent with focal cerebral arteriopathy, including elevated markers of systemic inflammation in both bilateral MCA strokes in one case and multiple organ system dysfunction in the other case. Neither patient fulfilled criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, given absence of fever. These cases illustrate that systemic postinfectious arteritis with cerebrovascular involvement may complicate COVID-19 infection in previously healthy school-aged children, and their presentations may overlap but not fulfill criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or focal cerebral arteriopathy.",2021,Journal Article,1,"The article is not relevant to the given PICOS as it discusses arteritis and large vessel occlusive strokes in children after COVID-19 infection, and does not focus on diagnostic accuracy or comparison of imaging modalities."
8,The arterial wall evaluation of vertebrobasilar artery dissection by magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging,"Background: High resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging (MR-VWI) has been used to explore some vascular diseases, including a vulnerable plaque of carotid artery stenosis or vessel inflammation of cerebral vasculopathy. However, this MR sequence has rarely been applied to vertebrobasilar dissection. Assuming that arterial dissection is associated with vessel wall inflammatory process, MR-VWI seems to be effective for evaluation of such a disease. In this report, we evaluated the efficacy of MR-VWI in patients with arterial dissection. Method: Five patients with nonhemorrhagic vertebrobasilar artery dissection were studied. MR-VWI was undertaken in all. MR imaging was performed by using a Skyra 3.0T scanner with a 32-channel head coil (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). The vessel wall protocol included time-of-flight MR angiography and T1-weighted black blood vessel wall sequence (turbo spin echo acquisition with field of view = 16.16 cm; acquired matrix = 256×256; slice thickness = 2 mm; total slab thickness =48mm; repetition time/echo time 590/10ms) before and after intravenous administration of gadolinium (with constant scan parameters). The range of arterial dissection was defined as the extent of the intimai flap, arterial stenosis and/or dilatation, fusiform aneurysm or thrombus on digital subtraction angiography and/or MR angiography. Result: Four patients had the vessel wall enhancement at the dissecting lesions. Three of them showed the enhancement of vessel walls proximal and/or distal to dissecting lesions. Two patients had the vessel wall enhancement at the contralateral vertebral artery as well as the dissecting artery. In some cases, the range of dissection was beyond that clarified by digital subtraction angiography or MR angiography. Discussion: It is speculated that the enhancement of vessel wall in MR-VWI indicates the inflammation of the dissecting vessel wall but not the dissection. Conclusion: MR-VWI is considered to elucidate a range of the affected vessel wall in detail as compared with the conventional methods.",2014,Journal Article,3,"The article is relevant to the PICOS as it discusses the efficacy of MR-VWI in evaluating arterial dissection, which is associated with vessel wall inflammatory process. However, the article does not specifically focus on patients with vasculitis or compare MR-VWI with other imaging modalities."
9,Evaluation of the arterial wall in vertebrobasilar artery dissection using high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging,"Background High-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging (HRMR-VWI) has been used to explore vascular diseases such as vasculitis and vulnerable plaque of intracranial arteries. Although vessel wall inflammation is suspected as one of the causes of cerebral arterial dissection, there have been few reports regarding the application of HRMR-VWI to arterial dissection. We have therefore evaluated the efficacy of HRMR-VWI in patients with vertebrobasilar artery dissection. Methods HRMR-VWI was performed on 5 patients who had been diagnosed with nonhemorrhagic vertebrobasilar artery dissection. Result Four patients exhibited vessel wall enhancement on HRMR-VWI, the range of which corresponded with the dissection sites identified by cerebral angiogram, magnetic resonance imaging, or magnetic resonance angiography. The enhancements observed in all cases were extensive as compared with the findings of conventional angiography. Conclusion HRMR-VWI is thought to elucidate the condition of the affected vessel wall more in detail as compared with conventional methods.",2016,Journal Article,1,"The article is not relevant to the PICOS as the population is patients with vertebrobasilar artery dissection, not vasculitis. The intervention is MR vessel wall imaging, but there is no comparison with other imaging modalities and the outcomes are not related to diagnostic accuracy or other metrics."
10,Intracranial vessel wall imaging,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To give an overview regarding the potential usefulness of vessel wall imaging (VWI) in distinguishing various intracranial vascular diseases, their common imaging features, and potential pitfalls. RECENT FINDINGS: VWI provides direct visualization of the vessel wall and allows the discrimination of different diseases such as vasculitis, atherosclerosis, dissection, Moyamoya disease, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Recent studies showed that concentric and eccentric involvement in the vessel wall, as well as the enhancement pattern were found important for the distinguishing these diseases and evaluating their activity. SUMMARY: Most of the imaging techniques currently used are based on luminal imaging. However, these imaging methods are not adequate to distinguish different diseases that can demonstrate similar radiological findings. VWI is being increasingly used as a noninvasive imaging method to offset this limitation.",2021,Journal Article,4,"The article is relevant to the PICOS as it discusses the potential usefulness of vessel wall imaging in distinguishing various intracranial vascular diseases, including vasculitis.

12,Measuring plaque inflammation in asymptomatic cocaine addicted individuals with 18F-FDG using simultaneous PET/MR imaging,"Background: Cocaine use is involved in 40% of emergency department visits, where positive toxicology for illicit drugs have been associated with stroke, coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, resulting in severe impairments or sudden mortality, even in the absence of prior vascular disease symptoms. Indeed, cocaine, a powerful vasoconstrictor and a sodium channel blocker, decreases basal antiinflammatory markers (Interleukin 10) and increases proinflammatory cytokines (Tumor necrosis factor alpha), contributing to progressive vascular inflammation (atherosclerosis). The carotid arteries supply blood to brain regions that are implicated in the higher-order cognitive impairments documented in individuals with cocaine use disorder (iCUD). Hence, structural and/or functional damage in the carotid arteries may impact cognitive and behavioral functioning even before substantial arterial narrowing results in clinical symptoms. We hypothesized that iCUD have significant vascular inflammation, which is modulated by history of drug use. Methods: Using Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance (PET/MR), we imaged the internal carotid arteries to assess atherosclerosis in 10 healthy iCUD aged 43 to 58 with cocaine lifetime use of 22.6± 7.3 years and without a history of neurological or cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Analyses for additional 4 iCUD and 10 matched healthy controls are ongoing. We compared results to findings in a sample at risk for CVD, aged 64.6 ±7.8. Amount of inflammation, measured with PET with 18 Ffluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG), was calculated by the maximum arterial wall (target) to background (blood) ratio (TBR). To measure enlargement of wall area and thickness of the vessel, we used MR with 3-Dimensional dark-blood sequence. Results: Results show that 78% of iCUD had inflamed plaque in arteries [TBRmax. (mean, SE) right (1.89,.12) left (1.7,.11); notably, TBR ≥ 1.6 is indicative of inflamed plaque]. Furthermore, in one sample t-tests using the comparison group's mean values, iCUD had thicker wall (mm; 1.63,.03 versus 1.27,.04, t(8) =8.84, p<.001) and larger wall area (mm2; 38.45, 1.48 versus 32.28, 1.43, t(8) =3.34, p =.01) indicating the presence of more plaque in the carotid than the much older comparison sample at risk for CVD. These PET/MR findings correlated significantly with cocaine use indices (lifetime use, craving, and addiction severity) and with nicotine and alcohol lifetime use where the more severe the drug use, the greater the carotid abnormalities (.53≤ r ≤ .85, p<.01). Conclusions: Replicating and extending previous results in an independent sample of healthy controls, these preliminary results show markers of carotid disease in CVDasymptomatic iCUD, which may exacerbate cognitive and behavioral impairments, of paramount clinical significance for combating silent disease progression.",2017,Journal Article,1,The article is not relevant to the given PICOS as it does not involve patients with vasculitis and does not compare MR vessel wall imaging with other imaging modalities for diagnostic accuracy.
13,Imaging plaque inflammation in asymptomatic cocaine addicted individuals with simultaneous positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging,"BACKGROUND: Chronic cocaine use is associated with stroke, coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, resulting in severe impairments or sudden mortality. In the absence of clear cardiovascular symptoms, individuals with cocaine use disorder (iCUD) seeking addiction treatment receive mostly psychotherapy and psychiatric pharmacotherapy, with no attention to vascular disease (i.e., atherosclerosis). Little is known about the pre-clinical signs of cardiovascular risk in iCUD and early signs of vascular disease are undetected in this underserved population. AIM: To assess inflammation, plaque burden and plaque composition in iCUD aiming to detect markers of atherosclerosis and vascular disease. METHODS: The bilateral carotid arteries were imaged with positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) in iCUD asymptomatic for cardiovascular disease, healthy controls, and individuals with cardiovascular risk. PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) evaluated vascular inflammation and 3-D dark-blood MRI assessed plaque burden including wall area and thickness. Drug use and severity of addiction were assessed with standardized instruments. RESULTS: The majority of iCUD and controls had carotid FDG-PET signal greater than 1.6 but lower than 3, indicating the presence of mild to moderate inflammation. However, the MRI measure of wall structure was thicker in iCUD as compared to the controls and cardiovascular risk group, indicating greater carotid plaque burden. iCUD had larger wall area as compared to the healthy controls but not as compared to the cardiovascular risk group, indicating structural wall similarities between the non-control study groups. In iCUD, wall area correlated with greater cocaine withdrawal and craving. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results show markers of carotid artery disease burden in cardiovascular disease-asymptomatic iCUD. Broader trials are warranted to develop protocols for early detection of cardiovascular risk and preventive intervention in iCUD.",2019,Journal Article,1,The article is not relevant to the given PICOS as it does not involve patients with vasculitis and does not compare MR vessel wall imaging with other imaging modalities for diagnostic accuracy.
14,Lumina-study: Gadolinium-enhanced aneurysm wall imaging of non-ruptured intracranial aneurysms,"Background: Current models to assess the rupture risk of intracranial aneurysms are inaccurate and fail to identify small aneurysms with a high risk of rupture. Therefore, new risk factors for aneurysm rupture need to be identified. Inflammationmay be a key modulator in aneurysm rupture. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with vessel wall imaging (VWI) can identify sites of inflammation in other vasculopathies such as vasculitis and intracranial atherosclerosis. Recent studies suggest that contrast enhancement of the aneurysm wall is associated with aneurysm growth or rupture. Design: Prospective single center cross-sectional study. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of contrast enhancement of the aneurysm wall and its predictors in patients with small unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Population: 80 patients ≥18 years with ≥1 small unruptured intracranial aneurysm(s). Outcome: Contrast enhancement of the aneurysm wall on 3 Tesla MRI with VWI. Statistical analyses: We will assess the proportion and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of aneurysms with contrast enhancement. With univariable and multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis we will calculate odds ratios and 95%CI for the association between contrast enhancement and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, aneurysm size, hypertension, and tobacco use. Yield: This study gives insight in the prevalence of contrast enhancement and its predictors in patients with small unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The results of this study will be used to design a prospective multicenter cohort study to investigate whether contrast enhancement of the aneurysm wall predicts aneurysm growth in small aneurysms that are left untreated. Status: 38 patients have been included.",2015,Journal Article,1,The article is not relevant to the given PICOS as it focuses on patients with small unruptured intracranial aneurysms and not vasculitis.
15,"Multi-territory strokes secondary to cerebral small vessel arteriosclerosis, associated with hypertension","Introduction: Cardio-embolic mechanisms, cerebral vasculitis, infection and genetic disorders can cause multi-territory strokes. We present a case of hypertension-related arteriosclerosis causing multifocal infarcts and a subacute neurological syndrome. Method: A 68-year-old man, with poorly-controlled hypertension and treated prostate cancer, presented with sub-acute deterioration of mobility, cognition and speech. Examination revealed gait ataxia, dysarthria and a positive Babinski sign. MRI demonstrated acute lacunar infarcts in the left corona radiata and parietal sub-cortical area with bilateral small-vessel disease and microbleeds. Carotid and vertebral arteries were patent on CT angiogram. No thrombus or shunts were found on cardiac MRI and bubble-echocardiogram. Holter monitoring demonstrated no atrial fibrillation. No evidence of infection or malignancy were found on cerebrospinal- fluid analysis, blood tests, fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (performed for suspected vasculitis) or CT covering thorax to pelvis. Lipids, glycosylated haemoglobin, thrombophilia screens, NOTCH3 genetic testing and alpha-galactosidase levels were unremarkable. Despite antiplatelet and statin therapy, new infarcts were found in the left cerebellum, corona radiata and periventricular regions on a 5-week interval MRI. Cerebral vasculitis was deemed unlikely following a negative MRI with black-blood sequences and no clinical response to highdose corticosteroids. Results: Arteriosclerosis of deep penetrating arteries can be caused by long-standing poorly-controlled hypertension. After careful consideration of above-mentioned differentials, the strokes were attributed to arteriosclerosis. Indeed, MRI studies have suggested that small-vessel disease can initially present as lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging. Conclusion: Arteriosclerosis can cause subacute neurology from the accumulation of multiple lacunar infarcts; diagnosis requires careful exclusion of other mechanisms.",2023,Journal Article,1,The article is not relevant to the PICOS as it does not involve MR vessel wall imaging or comparison with other imaging modalities for the diagnosis of vasculitis.
